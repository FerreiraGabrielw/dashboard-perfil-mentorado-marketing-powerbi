## About the Project

This project presents an analytical Dashboard developed in **Power BI** to profile individuals interested in mentorship and career development. The objective is to provide a detailed view of demographic characteristics, education, experience, and aspirations, empowering the company to understand its audience, personalize offerings, and optimize resource allocation.

## Technologies and Process

*   **Tools**: Power BI Desktop (DAX, M), Figma (prototyping and design).
*   **ETL**: Data extracted from **four Excel files (`.xls`)**, transformed in Power Query, and modeled for multidimensional analysis.
*   **Key Insights**: Demographic and professional profile (25-35 years old, single, Instagram as main source), high demand for career migration (87.88%), available study time (2-4h), gaps in SQL/Project Management, and need for agile methodology training.

## Repository Content

*   `data/`: Four Excel database files (`BaseDadosGeral.xls`, `BaseDadosJaneiro.xls`, `BaseDadosMarco.xls`, `BaseDadosMaio.xls`) used.
*   `powerbi/`: Power BI dashboard `.pbix` file.
*   `figma/`: Files related to the prototype and design in Figma.
