# Introduction

This project presents an analytical Dashboard developed to outline the profile of individuals interested in mentoring and career development. The main objective is to provide a detailed view of the mentees' demographic characteristics, academic background, professional experience, level of knowledge in various tools and technologies, and career aspirations. The dashboard aims to empower the company working with mentoring programs to better understand its target audience, personalize training offers, optimize resource allocation, and identify talents with high potential for development and career migration.

## Project Structure

The dashboard is organized to offer a multidimensional analysis of individual profiles:

*   **Profile Overview**: Total number of people analyzed, gender distribution, and conversion rate.
*   **Demographic Data**: Age group, marital status, lead source, and geographical distribution by state.
*   **Professional and Academic Profile**: Average salary, education, interest in migrating to other areas, and available study time.
*   **Tool Knowledge Level**: Detailed assessment of knowledge in SQL, Project Management, Power BI, Data, and Excel, as well as familiarity with agile methodologies (Kanban/Scrum).

## Technologies Used

For the construction of this analytical dashboard, the tools employed were:

*   **Power BI Desktop**: To connect the four Excel databases, perform the necessary modeling and transformation, develop DAX measures for complex calculations, and build the interactive visuals that compose the dashboard.
*   **Figma**: The prototyping and design of the dashboard were done with Figma, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.

## ETL Process (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading)

The ETL process for the Mentee Profile Analysis Dashboard was structured to integrate information from various sources, ensuring a complete and accurate view:

1.  **Extraction**: Raw data was extracted from four distinct databases, all in Excel format. Each database likely contained specific information about an aspect of the mentee's profile.
2.  **Transformation**: In Power Query, an integral part of Power BI, various cleaning and enrichment operations were performed. This included:
    *   Data treatment, such as field standardization and value correction.
    *   Creation of new columns and calculated metrics essential for analyses, using the M language.
    *   Data modeling was crucial. Relationships were established between the four databases, ensuring that all information could be correctly aggregated and filtered for multidimensional profile analyses.
3.  **Loading**: After the extraction and transformation steps, the data was loaded into the Power BI data model, ready to feed all the charts and tables of the dashboard, allowing for interactive exploration of the analyzed profiles.

# Dashboard

With an organization that facilitates the understanding of the diverse characteristics of individuals. The interface combines KPI cards for general totals, donut and bar charts for percentage distributions (gender, age group, marital status), horizontal bar charts for rankings (lead source, states), and bar visuals for knowledge levels and study time. Interactivity is a central feature, allowing filtering by different dimensions and facilitating the identification of specific mentee segments.

## Insights

The analysis of the data presented in the dashboard revealed valuable insights into the mentees' profiles:

*   **Main Audience and Conversion Rate**:
    *   The dashboard indicates a **Total Buyers** of 660 individuals.
    *   The overall **Conversion Rate** is 67%, with 71.06% Male Buyers and 28.94% Female Buyers.
    *   Interestingly, 23.18% of Buyers have children, providing a detail about the family profile.

  </div>

*   **Professional Profile and Aspirations**:
    *   The **Average Salary** of participants is R\$ 3,778, providing a financial overview.
      <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="imagem7.png" alt="" />
  </div>
    *   A significant percentage of **87.88%** of individuals are interested in **Migrating to a New Area**, underscoring the pursuit of development and new career opportunities.
          <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="imagem8.png" alt="" />
  </div>
    *   Regarding **Available Study Time**, most dedicate **2 to 4 hours (270 people)**, followed by 1 to 2 hours (236 people), which is important for planning study programs.

  </div>

*   **Knowledge Level and Education**:
    *   Knowledge in **Excel (66.21%)** is the highest, followed by Knowledge in Data (44.85%) and Power BI (22.58%). Knowledge in **SQL (14.55%)** and **Project Management (18.33%)** is lower, indicating potential gaps.
         <div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="imagem10.png" alt="" />

## Considerations

The dashboard provides a solid foundation for enhancing training programs and recruitment strategies. Based on the insights obtained, some important considerations arise:

*   **Skills Development**: There is a clear demand for knowledge in **Data** and **Excel**, and an opportunity for foundational programs in **Power BI** and **SQL**, as many are at a basic level or have never had contact.
*   **Attraction and Engagement**: Instagram is an effective channel for attracting leads. Understanding the audience profile (young adults, singles) and their aspirations (career migration, seeking development) can optimize engagement campaigns.
*   **Adaptation of Study Programs**: Most mentees have 2 to 4 hours available for study, which should be considered when structuring the workload and format of courses.
*   **Agile Methodology Training**: The high proportion of people without contact or with difficulty in Kanban/Scrum suggests a large latent demand for this skill, essential in today's job market.
*   **Segmentation by Region**: The concentration of leads in states like SP, RS, and RJ can guide resource allocation and the execution of in-person or regionally focused events.

## Conclusion

The Dashboard was a strategic analytical tool that transformed raw data into actionable intelligence that generated impact for the company. Its main contribution lies in its ability to:

*   Provide a detailed overview of the demographic, academic, and professional characteristics of mentees.
*   Identify knowledge gaps and areas of high demand for skills development.
*   Enable the personalization of training offers and the optimization of engagement strategies.
